# Computer-Vision-Basics

The following pdf's show the code and outputs of the various tasks performed as part of the Computer Vision elective.

1) Lab1
- Capture images using webcam
- Check how to find color space of image
- Perform basic operations like, resizing, plot histograms and perform affine operations on images.

2) Lab2
- caliberate a camera and find camera parameters and matrices.

3) Lab3
- Caliberate stereo camera (binocular vision) and find stereo parameters.

4) Lab4
- Generate 3-D point cloud using binocular vision i.e using 2 cameras

5) Lab5
- Track an object by estimating its motion in video sequence

6) Lab6 
- Develop feature algorithm (HOG)

7) Lab7
- Add feature information along with its motion to track an object in video sequence
